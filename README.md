# PChron

### Soon to be the number one frozen pizza website in the world!

## Installation

1. Install a local PHP and mysql capable application.
	- I use Xampp from https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html
	- You will also need to add PHP as an executable on your computer... Something like https://john-dugan.com/add-php-windows-path-variable/.
3. Start your local PHP server and mysql server.
2. Clone this project into your local repository.
3. run `node -v` to make sure you have node v 10.3+
4. run `npm install` to get local packages
5. run `php -f install` to intilize the database.
6. run `npm run dev` to start the application
7. Navigate to localhost:3000
8. Profit!
